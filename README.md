### GMorse19

I like to build things. Currently, I am building with JavaScript, React.js, and Ruby on Rails, but I also have experience building with musical instruments, cameras, power tools and my bare hands.

I am currently working, collaboratively, on a small mobile app aimed at helping patients with Parkinson's disease. **(React.js, React Native, and C#)**

Other Areas of Interest: Express.js, Node.js, wood-working, postgreSQL, camping, sketching, NoSQL, MongoDB, music(anything from Bach up to and including 80's hair metal), hockey, BootStrap, SaSS, geocaching, film-making
